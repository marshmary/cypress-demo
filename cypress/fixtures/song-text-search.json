        "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser]\n\nSome deserts on this planet were oceans once\n\nSomewhere shrouded by the night, the sun will shine\n\nSometimes I see a dying bird fall to the ground\n\nBut it used to fly so high\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser]\n\nI thought I were no more than a bystander\n\nTill I felt a touch so real\n\nI will no longer be a transient when I see smiles with tears\n\nIf I have never known the sore of farewell and pain of sacrifices\n\nWhat else should I engrave on my mind?\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser, Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser]\n\nFrozen into icy rocks, that’s how it starts (that's how it starts)\n\nCrumbled like the sands of time, that’s how it ends (that’s how it ends)\n\nEvery page of tragedy is thrown away (is thrown away)\n\nBurned out in the flame\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser]\n\nA shoulder for the past\n\nLet out the cries imprisoned for so long\n\nA pair of wings for me at this moment\n\nTo soar above this world\n\nTurn into a shooting star that briefly shines but warms up every heart\n\nMay all the beauty be blessed\n\nMay all the beauty be blessed\n&nbsp;\n[Bridge]\n\n(I will never go)\n\n(There’s a way back home)\n\n(Brighter than tomorrow and yesterday)\n\n(May all the beauty be blessed)\n\n\n\n[Post-Chorus: Chalili, TetraCalyx, Hanser]\n\nWave good-bye to the past\n\nWhen hope and faith have grown so strong and sound\n\n(Have grown so strong and sound)\n\nUnfold this pair of wings for me again\n\nTo soar above this world\n\n(To soar above this world)\n\nTurned into a moon that always tells the warmth and brightness of the sun\n\n(Brightness of the sun)\n\nMay all the beauty be blessed\n\nMay all the beauty be blessed\n&nbsp;",
